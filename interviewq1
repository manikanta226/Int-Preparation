What does the following code output and why?
void foo(void)
{
unsigned int a = 6;
int b = -20;(a+b > 6) ? puts(“> 6”) : puts(“<= 6”);}

{
*result = a + b;
/*Add single condition here to determine integer overflow*/
return 0;
}

Bacteria is known to multiply rapidly. A container contains only 1 bacteria on the first day and there are twice as many on the next day.
in this manner the number of bacteria doubles itself everyday. Assuming from the container size it will be full of bacteria on 10th day,
on which day container will be 1/4?
